Human Emotion Detection Using Neural Networks

*Project Overview :*

This project explores the use of neural networks to detect human emotions from images, employing machine learning and computer vision techniques to classify emotions accurately. The notebook demonstrates how to set up a neural network model using libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-Learn to preprocess image data and train a reliable classifier. This project aims to enhance emotion recognition in applications ranging from human-computer interaction to video analysis.

*Project Structure :*

  - Data Preparation: Loads and preprocesses the emotion dataset, resizing and normalizing images.
    
  - Model Configuration and Training: Sets up a neural network architecture and trains it to classify emotions based on the input images.
    
  - Evaluation and Visualization: Uses metrics and visualizations to evaluate model performance and interpret the classification results.

*Results :*

The notebook provides model evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and loss, along with visualizations like confusion matrices. These insights demonstrate the neural networkâ€™s effectiveness in recognizing different human emotions.
